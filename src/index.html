								<li><span style="height: 50px; float: left;">…</span>doing a lot of presentations… you are bringing the deep level of knowledge of the list and all technologies that come with it.</li>
								<li><span style="height: 60px; float: left;">…</span>it is sitting quietly at your computer, completely, deeply involved into a spreadsheet so that you can make data-driven decisions all the way to being the public face of Pearson and everything in-between.</li>

						<div class="t1 light">Share a skill that was most relevant for your career success and becoming a Field Marketer.</div>
						<div class="t2"><b>Responsiveness…</b><br/> customers need to know that customer service is important to <i>you</i>. It is not just about getting a square peg into the round hole to get the sale right at that moment. It is about developing a relationship over time and you being there to support it.</div>
						<div class="t3"><b>Excellent communication skills:</b><br/> verbal and written. Ability to tailor communication to the audience and make it clear and simple.</div>
						<div class="t4"><b>...constant work ethic</b><br/> and never wanting to say "no" to opportunities.</div>
						<div class="g1"></div> <div class="g2"></div> <div class="g3"></div> <div class="g4"></div> <div class="g5"></div> <div class="g6"></div> <div class="g7"></div>

					<li class="slide slide3">
						<div class="t1 light">What advice would you have for someone new to the FM role?</div>
						<div class="t2 light">...be the advocate for the rep, professor, student... when it comes to allocating time, money, and resources, you are the voice from the trenches... make sure that you have a constant flow of communication so that your team (editors, efficacy, etc.) can make the best informed decisions.</div>
						<div class="t3 light">...you work for the reps and not the other way around... create tools that sales reps find easy to use and help them tell a story.</div>
						<div class="t4">...the common thread in everything you do is finding a way to help customers connect to what makes our products special, what makes them a superior teaching and learning experience.</div>
						<div class="t5">...talk to your peers. There is such a fantastic pool of knowledge, creativity, experience, willingness to help...it is instrumental part of hitting the ground running.</div>
						<div class="g1"></div> <div class="g2"></div> <div class="g3"></div> <div class="g4"></div>
					</li>
					<li class="slide slide4">
						<div class="t1 light">What personal characteristics make you successful?</div>
						<div class="t2">...you have to have a lot of organizational skills because multitasking in Field Marketing is to the tenth degree.</div>
						<div class="t3">Sense of humor. People remember how they felt while having a conversation. And if they felt you are knowledgeable and also a fun person to work with they’ll keep coming back with questions, for help, or brainstorming...and that is how good relationships are built.</div>
						<div class="g1"></div> <div class="g2"></div> <div class="g3"></div> <div class="g4"></div> <div class="g5"></div> <div class="g6"></div> <div class="g7"></div>
					</li>
					<li class="slide slide5">
						<div class="t1 light">What do you wish you would have known when you first started in this role?</div>
						<div class="t2 light">Life on the road... can drain you physically, emotionally, and intellectually. You have to force yourself to take time off for yourself... You really need to learn to turn it [computer, phone] off because you need time to re-charge.</div>
						<div class="t3 light">This job is so varied. It is not just rep training, not just product information, not just working with authors, or students. It is little bit of a whole lot of really fun things!</div>
						<div class="g1"></div> <div class="g2"></div> <div class="g3"></div> <div class="g4"></div> 
					</li>
					<li class="slide slide6">
						<div class="t1 light">What new skills have you learned that you didn't use while you were in field sales?</div>
						<div class="t2">...there are times you find yourself on the spot, suddenly having audience and they want to hear about a new product or new technology...being able to give a compelling, interesting, factually-accurate and, hopefully, humorous presentation about pretty much anything people are going to throw at you is the skill to be honed.</div>
						<div class="t3">Develop people reading skills so that you know how to frame your discussion...learn, adapt, and adjust to the territory and its people.</div>
						<div class="t4">Foster our team comradery and manage different personalities to be effective as one team.</div>
						<div class="g1"></div> <div class="g2"></div> 
					</li>
					<li class="slide slide7">
						<div class="t1 light">What resources, tools or relationships have had the most impact on your career?</div>
						<div class="t2"><b>WebEx</b>: using technology that is more personal than a phone pulls you together.</div>
						<div class="t3">The peer-to-peer learning had the most impact.</div>
						<div class="t4"><b>Synch</b>: sharing information with professors and getting the metrics back about how they interacted with it helps make inferences about their priorities.</div>
						<div class="g1"></div> <div class="g2"></div> <div class="g3"></div> 
					</li>
					<li class="slide slide8">
						<div class="t1 light">Is there anything you wished you had done to prepare for this job while you were still in your prior role?</div>
						<div class="t2">Accept any work-trip invites you get because the more people you work with the better rep you will be. Pull the best of the best of every one.</div>
						<div class="t3">There is a training function in this job: you are modeling behavior not only about your list/product knowledge but also about how to conduct an interview and assess needs of a professor and a student.</div>
